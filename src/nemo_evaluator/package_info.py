"""Package version constants.

The canonical version is in pyproject.toml; this file mirrors it as
``MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH/PRE_RELEASE`` constants because the FW-CI-templates
``_build_test_publish_wheel.yml`` reusable workflow patches ``PATCH``
in-place for dry-run wheel builds. Removing it would break that build.

When pyproject.toml's ``version`` is bumped, update the constants below
to keep them in sync.
